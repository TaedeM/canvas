        {
          "label": "Project Text Analysis",
          "content": "Introduced to processing large textual datasets using Python and the NLTK library. It covers fundamental language processing tasks, including tokenization, Part of Speech (POS)-tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and sense-tagging, both theoretically and practically. Learned to implement these techniques, evaluate data annotation, and set up NLP projects from scratch. Practical assignments reinforce classroom learning, culminating in a group project where students develop an NLP system using off-the-shelf tools. Additionally, the course fosters teamwork skills and awareness of current challenges in text processing."

        {
          "label": "Digital Communication",
          "content": "An introduction to computer-mediated communication (CMC), covering instant messaging, video chat, email, social media, and virtual reality. Students will develop basic knowledge and analytical skills to understand the cognitive, linguistic, and social aspects of CMC, including its possibilities, limitations, and implications. A key focus is how different media influence interaction compared to face-to-face communication, exploring why certain media suit specific interactions better and how they address miscommunication. The course also examines language change, highlighting how CMC fosters new linguistic and communicative conventions, serving as preparation for advanced studies in CIW and IK."

      "questions": [
        {
          "label": "Introduction to Neural Networks",
          "content": "Gained a foundational understanding of neural networks (NNs), covering simple linear classifiers, feed-forward neural networks, and recurrent NNs. Learned how these models work and the basic training techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent. Also gained practical experience implementing, training, and testing NN models using Python-based deep learning frameworks like Keras or PyTorch. The course highlights the conceptual differences between simple models and more advanced architectures like LSTMs, and teaches students to select appropriate NN models for text classification tasks. Additionally, students will evaluate the advantages and limitations of using deep learning compared to other machine learning methods in natural language processing."

        {
          "label": "Search Engines",
          "content": "This module covers methods and techniques used in information systems, particularly for unstructured text, such as search engines and information retrieval systems. Topics include text preparation, indexing, boolean and vector models, ranked retrieval, evaluation of search systems, and the PageRank algorithm. Students will gain hands-on experience through Python programming exercises, focusing on optimizing the efficiency of these systems when working with large data collections. Additionally, they will learn about search engine models, their internal structures, and processes, as well as how to evaluate search engine performance."
        },
        {
          "label": "Databases",
          "content": "Database design, management, and analysis. Gained knowledge of digital data storage, data treatment, and analysis techniques. They will learn to design and implement relational databases using the E-R Model and SQL for data manipulation and queries. The course also covers database design theory, including functional dependencies and normalization. Additionally, students will be introduced to non-relational databases (NoSQL). The practical approach of the course equips students with the skills to work with databases and use contemporary tools for efficient data management."
        },
        {
          "label": "Conversational Interfaces",
          "content": "The development and evaluation of conversational interfaces, such as chatbots, spoken dialogue systems, and talking robots. Students will explore state-of-the-art techniques in human-machine conversation, learning to handle typed or spoken input, manage dialogue, and generate appropriate responses. The course emphasizes the use of language technology to create effective and efficient conversational systems. By the end, students will be able to characterize and apply current methods in the design and evaluation of these interfaces."
