A few words about me

#intro
Full stack developer based in Sneek, Friesland

#intro2
With 10+ years of coding experience, I enjoy creating programs that simplify workflow and are technically advanced. My main goal is efficiency, from removing unnecesary clicks in a customer journey, to creating my own web app just to manage my own Spotify playlists.

Even when I'm not working for my clients, I'm always looking for new things to learn and experiment with. I continue to develop my design and development skills by working on personal projects, keeping up with the latest news on LLMs & Nuxt, etc...
