A few words about me

#intro
Full stack developer based in Sneek, Friesland.

#intro2
With 10+ years of coding experience, I enjoy creating programs that simplify workflow and are technically advanced. My main goal is efficiency, from removing unnecesary clicks in a customer journey, to creating an app just to manage my own Spotify playlists, after being annoyed that I can not see if a song is already in a playlist.

#intro3
For my job at Snakeware, I've already made various projects, ranging from a search engine for supermarket products, a chatbot containing company specific knowledge and a conversational interface that sets filters on a booking site based on natural language. Moreover, I gathered minor experience in creating APIs with dotnet and worked on plenty of Nuxt sites.

#intro4
Even when I'm not working, I'm always looking for new things to learn and experiment with. I continue to develop my skills by working on personal projects, keeping up with the latest news on Large Language Models, Nuxt, etc...
